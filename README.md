# flatbuffers-net

A work in progress / experimental serialization library for FlatBuffers in .NET.

 This library provides utilities to allow a *Code-First* workflow when using FlatBuffers in .NET projects. It is designed for situations whereby you wish to sacrifice the performance and low-allocation characteristics of FlatBuffers yet still wish to interact with it as a data format.
